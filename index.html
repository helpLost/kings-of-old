            <p class="content-section-title">What is "RDA"?</p>
            <p id="game" class="content-section-paragraph">Rising Dawns: Adventure is a singleplayer, mostly textual,
                browser-run civilization builder. You're given the power to control a nation throughout the ages of
                humanity from 4,300 BCE into the far future. Fight against or alongside other civilizations in the
                world, and your choices will have a major impact on how the world develops.</p>
            <p id="examples" class="content-section-paragraph">Here's an example: Imagine you've chosen the region of
                Western Europe. During the 500s, when the Anglo-Saxons conquer the plains of Britain, you decide to wage
                war and wipe them out. England, and by extension the United Kingdom will never form and Europe's
                development will change as a result, new, more Celtic countries will form in Britain, and it may never
                be united.</p>
            <p class="content-section-paragraph">But who's to say how you'll play? Perhaps you'll be a peaceful farming
                kingdom that keeps to their own buisness and is one day conquered by a warmonger neighbor nation. That's
                completely okay, as you can fight as a resistance to regain your independence. The game doesn't end
                until your people do.</p>
