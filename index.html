You play as the divinely chosen leader of a tribe in 4,300BCE. <br> Take your tribe throughout the ages, research new techs, build up your cities, and fight in meaningless wars to expand your <br>influence. Play however you want; you can stay a peaceful farming civilization, go fight wars constantly in a far off land, or <br> maybe just conquer a small area and lord over your subjects. The opportunities are endless.
