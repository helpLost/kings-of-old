# Rising Dawns
Rising Dawns is an HTML5 and Javascript based civilization/empire building game. Created for fun, enjoy!

Rising Dawns is created by a small dev team based in the US. Programmed and styled with Macbooks in mind specifically.
Inspiration taked from CivClicker originally, and Age of Empires as well.
Version history and changelog can be found at kings-of-old/Content/Game/Versions/versions.txt.
Please give credit to us specifically when reposting, remaking, or changing any part of this game for your own private purposes.

**KEEP IN MIND:**
>
Rising Dawns only has one programmer, one musician, one artist, and 2 playtesters at the moment. _Please_ give us time to fix bugs and issues or add 
features, unless it is extremely urgent.

## Project Outline

Graphic integration is planned for v0.2.0a. A randomly-generated **map**, however, is planned for v1.0.65a.
Art is in progress, sprites and the like will be packaged in with "graphic integration".
Season-changing background artwork is planned for v0.1.75a.

#### NOTICE:
**_Graphic integration is going to happen whenever I'm completely done coding all the functionality of the current game. Expect very few new features until graphic integration is began._**

v0.1.58a is planned to be a major functionality change, changing almost all of the building functions and mechanics, along with adding the very first
achievements (Seven in total).

App is planned for v.1.0.0b.
App's current planned language is C++ or C#, but that may change.

Migration from Github is planned for v1.3.0b. This is when the game will _officially_ change out of the public domain, except for the versions currently
uploaded to Github. Those will stay in the public domain.

Getting mod support available is planned for v0.8.0a.

### To-Do
_Getting v0.1.6a completely stable is of the utmost importance right now._

Getting background art is a secondary objective.

Full graphic integration is a secondary objective, full game functionality is needed first.

Mod support is probably the least important objective, as there's nothing but a general idea of a game currently up. Full graphic integration is required 
first.
